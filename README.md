# Nuxt 3 Jus Mundi Test for job aplication.
In order to join the company as a front end web developer a test was asked to do to get an idea of the candidate's skill level.

# Choices and details
Since it is a Nuxt 3 project, it is using Vue. It also allows us to separate the code in many portions with components and layouts.
The choice of Nuxt is because it offers a solid base project ready to use and has many coding facilities like in-built router, no imports needed, useful modules and obviously because I have a good knowledge of it.

A few modules made for Nuxt 3 were used in this project:
- @nuxtjs/tailwindcss
- @vueuse/motion/nuxt

The project has a responsive view as well for mobile.
